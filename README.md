# SnapGuide

## Description

SnapGuide is a tool that brings Photoshop-like guides to web. It lets you put down guides that snap intelligently to the page content. It snaps to borders and padding, and will even snap to the baseline of text. There is on-screen help with a list of shortcuts.

Unlike some extensions it will not interfere with any webpage you visit unless you click the Tape icon.

Once installed:
Click icon to activate. Read help, or press Space to dismiss it.
Mouse over document, observe that rules snap to useful positions (including baselines!), and use keys as follows:

>  
> V - add vertical rule  
> H - add horisontal rule  
> Q - remove all guides  
> ←, ↑, →, ↓  - move cursor 1px (+ Shift 10px)  
> Space - toggle help
>
